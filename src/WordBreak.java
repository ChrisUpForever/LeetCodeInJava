     * 139. Word Break
     * Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

     For example, given
     s = "leetcode",
     dict = ["leet", "code"].

     Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

     UPDATE (2017/1/4):
     The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
