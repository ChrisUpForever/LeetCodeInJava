     * 60. Permutation Sequence
     * The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

     By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
     We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

     "132"
     "213"
     "231"
     "312"
     "321"

     Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

     * Solution 2:
     * For a number n, could divid into n groups of (n - 1) permutations, like 3 could group by 1permutation(2,3) + 2permutation(1,3) + 3permutation(1,2)
     * The idea is after divide by the number of rest group permutations, say (n - 1)!, we left 1, 2, 3 array, and the k / (n-1)! result is the index of 1,2,3, then add to string (as need to smallest order)
     * Go the divide and conquer step, the second position is after divide (n - 2)!, search the right index in n - 1 array
     * k goes to the mold value after divide the factors[i]
     * So first we need one number list to store all numbers from 1 to n, for search the number to append to string
     * Another factors array to store all factor result from 1 to n - 1 (first step is divide (n-1)! to have a 1,2,3 array)
     *
     * Time: O(n) for loop * O(n) list delete & search = O(n^2)
     * Space: O(n) nums array + O(n) factors array  = O(n)
